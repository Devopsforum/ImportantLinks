To install epel on the instance use this command
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm

once its installed try installing the epel repo using 
sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm

later update the yum on the machine and node machines as well using 
sudo yum update

now using the below command install the ansible on the machines
sudo yum install ansible -y


once the installation is done please check whether its installed proper or not using the below command,
ansible --version

check in the ansible.cfg for the details of the modules and paths

to enable logs of ansible and to check what happens at the backend, just enable the logs in the ansible.cfg file by using the command,
sudo vi ansible.cfg <and search for /logging, then enable logs by removing the # i.e. log_path) before doing this you need to set the dir to ansible folder using the command 
cd /etc/ansible/
and then edit for the log enabling 

we need to change the permissions for the log file to make it writable. use the below mentioned command to change the permissions.
sudo touch /var/log/ansible.log (create the log file first) and then change the permissions.
sudo chmod 777 /var/log/ansible.log

Lets discuss about the configuration of the ansible by going through the ansible.cfg file located in /etc/ansible/ 

always take a backup of the ansible.cfg file using the command
sudo cp ansible.cfg ansible.cfg.original

Phyton has got the dependency for ansible and this we can see the python files using the mentioned command,
sudo yum list installed|grep -i python

check the whether python is installed on the machines and nodes 
use python as command and it will give the version of installed python and to come out of the python use quit()


to check the file paths use the mentioned command,
set|grep -i <filename> --- example set|grep -i ansible --- results PWD=/etc/ansible

to change the file path which was set for ansible.cfg just use the command,
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=<set the path you need to pick> 

check the changed path of ansible config file to new location, 
set|grep -i ansible this will give the overriden file path.

to check the defined hosts in the /etc/ansible/hosts file use the command,
ansible all --list-hosts

Just edit the hosts file by adding the code like
[local]
localhost
[apacheweb]
IP-address
[appserver]
IP-address

as shown below

[local]
localhost
[apacheweb]
172.31.30.39
172.31.18.50
[appserver]
172.31.28.196

when you try ping of the hosts it will give the mentioned results

[test@ip-172-31-19-7 ansible]$ ansible apacheweb -m ping
172.31.18.50 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
172.31.30.39 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

to stop the node/machine use the command,
stay in the machine you need to stop and type -----> sudo systemctl stop sshd and to check the status of this machine use ----> sudo service sshd status
